Hello, my name is Torie Nance and I'm currently a senior at California State Univeristy, San Bernardino completing my studies towards a B.S. in Information Systems and Techonology with a Concentration in Cyber Security.
This repository acts as a place to store the different projects I have/am currently working on, whether related to cyber or not.
I currently know the following programming languages: Python, C, C# C++, Java, JavaScript, all in addition to knowing how to write code in HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL.

I have experience writing code dealing with creating algorithms for security purposes (ex. rot13 encoders), creating programs that incorporate automation for everyday processes (ex. the various Canvas projects), and also creating video games (ex. the C programs), among more.
